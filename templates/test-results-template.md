# Test Results - Version {{VERSION}}

This directory contains the results of test version {{VERSION}} of our specialized agents with the mock authentication service project.

## Test Overview

We conducted a test of our four specialized agents:

1. **Code Reviewer Agent**
2. **Security Code Reviewer Agent**
3. **Testing Expert Agent**
4. **Documentation Writer Agent**

## Test Artifacts

During this test, the agents created or modified the following files:

- `docs/api.md` - API documentation
- `tests/authService.test.js` - Test suite

These files were generated in their respective directories and demonstrate the types of output our agents would produce. They have been preserved in the `artifacts/` subdirectory to maintain the original directory structure while keeping them organized within this version's directory:

- `artifacts/docs/api.md` - API documentation
- `artifacts/tests/authService.test.js` - Test suite

This preserves the artifacts for historical reference while maintaining a clean state in the main project directories for future testing.

## Important Note

This test used [actual agents / general-purpose agents simulating actual agents] rather than [the opposite]. [Explanation of approach taken and why].

## Future Testing

For future tests, we recommend:
1. Testing actual agent invocation in the proper context
2. Using simple sequential versioning (v1, v2, v3, etc.) for test iterations
3. Maintaining clean test environments between iterations
4. Preserving test artifacts for historical reference
