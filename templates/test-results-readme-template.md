# Test Results Documentation

This directory contains the results of various tests conducted on our agent system using the mock authentication service project.

## Directory Structure

Each version of tests is stored in a separate directory with a simple sequential version number:

- `v1/` - First test ({{DATE}})
- `v2/` - Second test (future)
- `v3/` - Third test (future)

## Versioning Approach

We use simple sequential versioning for our test iterations:

- **v1**: First test
- **v2**: Second test  
- **v3**: Third test
- And so on...

This approach is simple, clear, and avoids the complexity of semantic versioning.

## Latest Test Results

The most recent test results can be found in the `v1` directory, which contains:

1. **Test Results Summary** - Overview of the test results
2. **Test Artifacts** - Files generated by agents during testing

## Test Methodology

In each test, we:

1. Start with a clean testing environment using `./scripts/agent-test.sh start`
2. Run our four specialized agents on the mock authentication service
3. Preserve test artifacts in the `artifacts/` subdirectory
4. Document key findings and results

## Future Testing

For future tests, we plan to:

1. Test actual agent invocation in the proper context
2. Evaluate agent performance with different programming languages and frameworks
3. Test cross-agent collaboration scenarios
4. Validate agent effectiveness with real-world projects
