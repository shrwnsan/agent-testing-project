# Test Project for Agents

This is a mock project designed to test the capabilities of our subagents team:

1. Code Reviewer
2. Security Code Reviewer
3. Testing Expert
4. Documentation Writer

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Source code directory
- `tests/` - Test files
- `docs/` - Documentation files
- `package.json` - Project configuration

## Test Scenarios

1. **Code Reviewer**: Review the authentication service for general code quality
2. **Security Code Reviewer**: Review the authentication service for security vulnerabilities
3. **Testing Expert**: Create unit tests for the authentication service
4. **Documentation Writer**: Create API documentation for the authentication service

This project is intentionally simple but contains enough complexity to test all agent capabilities.
