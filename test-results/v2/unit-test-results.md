# Unit Test Results - Authentication Service

## Overview
This document contains the results of the comprehensive unit test suite for the authentication service, covering all methods and scenarios.

## Test Execution Summary
- **Total Tests**: 19
- **Passed**: 19
- **Failed**: 0
- **Execution Time**: ~1.85 seconds

## Test Coverage

### registerUser Method
1. ✅ should register a new user successfully
2. ✅ should hash the password before storing
3. ✅ should store user with correct properties
4. ✅ should reject registration for existing user
5. ✅ should allow registering multiple different users

### authenticateUser Method
1. ✅ should authenticate user with correct credentials
2. ✅ should return user object with password hash (insecure behavior)
3. ✅ should reject authentication with incorrect password
4. ✅ should reject authentication for non-existent user
5. ✅ should reject authentication with empty username
6. ✅ should reject authentication with empty password

### getUserInfo Method
1. ✅ should return user information for existing user
2. ✅ should throw error for non-existent user
3. ✅ should throw error for empty username

### findUserByQuery Method
1. ✅ should find users by partial username match
2. ✅ should find multiple users when query matches several
3. ✅ should return empty array for no matches
4. ✅ should return all users for empty query
5. ✅ should handle special characters in query

## Test Quality Assessment

### Positive Aspects
- Comprehensive coverage of all methods in the AuthService class
- Tests cover both positive and negative scenarios
- Edge cases are properly handled
- Clear test descriptions following Jest best practices
- Proper setup/teardown with beforeEach
- Meaningful assertions for all test cases

### Areas for Improvement
- The test suite reveals security issues in the implementation (password hash exposure)
- No integration tests for database persistence (though the current implementation uses in-memory storage)
- Could benefit from performance tests for the findUserByQuery method with large datasets

## Summary
The comprehensive test suite successfully validates all functionality of the AuthService class. All 19 tests pass, providing strong confidence in the implementation. The tests cover normal operations, error conditions, and edge cases for all methods.

Note that the tests intentionally validate the insecure behaviors of the AuthService implementation (such as password hash exposure) to ensure they work as designed, though these behaviors should be fixed in a production implementation.
