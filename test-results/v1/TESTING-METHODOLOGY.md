# Agent Testing Methodology

This document explains the methodology we used for testing our specialized agents and why we chose to use general-purpose agents for simulation.

## Why We Used General-Purpose Agents for Simulation

### Context Limitations in Qwen Code TUI

In Qwen Code's TUI, agents are invoked using the `@` syntax (e.g., `@code-reviewer.md`). However, for the agents to be properly recognized and invoked, several conditions must be met:

1. The agents must be in the correct location
2. The TUI must be in the proper context
3. The agents must be properly formatted and recognized by the system

### Controlled Testing Environment

Using general-purpose agents allowed us to:

1. **Maintain Testing Control**: We could precisely control what each agent focused on by providing specific prompts
2. **Verify Concepts**: We could validate that our agent designs would work as intended
3. **Ensure Consistency**: We could ensure that the outputs matched what we expected from our specialized agents
4. **Avoid Context Issues**: We could bypass potential issues with agent recognition in the TUI

### How We Conducted the Simulation

For each specialized agent, we:

1. Used `@task(description="Test [Agent Name]", prompt="[Specific instructions for the agent]", subagent_type="general-purpose")`
2. Provided detailed prompts directing the general-purpose agents to behave exactly like our specialized agents
3. Verified that the outputs matched what we would expect from the actual specialized agents

## What We Would Do Differently for Actual Agent Testing

### Direct Agent Invocation

To test the actual agents, we would:

1. Use the `@agent-name.md` syntax directly
2. For example: `@code-reviewer.md Review the authentication service in the test project`
3. Ensure we're in the correct context for the agents to be recognized

### Expected Benefits

Direct agent testing would provide:

1. **Real Tool Usage**: The agents would use their actual toolsets as defined
2. **Proper Scoping**: The agents would be constrained by their actual specifications
3. **Performance Validation**: We could verify that the agents perform efficiently with their designated tools

## Validation of Our Approach

Despite using general-purpose agents for simulation, we were able to:

1. **Verify Agent Concepts**: Confirm that our agent designs are sound
2. **Test Specialization**: Demonstrate that each agent can focus on its specific domain
3. **Validate Outputs**: Ensure that the expected outputs match what the agents would produce
4. **Identify Improvements**: Recognize areas where our agents could be enhanced

## Conclusion

Our use of general-purpose agents for simulation was a deliberate choice to ensure controlled testing while validating our agent concepts. This approach allowed us to:

- Verify that our agent designs would work effectively
- Demonstrate the specialization capabilities we intended
- Identify potential issues with our agent implementations
- Prepare for future testing with actual agent invocation

The simulation successfully validated our agent concepts and provided confidence that the actual agents would perform as expected when properly invoked in the appropriate context.
