# Test Results Documentation

This directory contains the results of various tests conducted on our agent system using the mock authentication service project.

## Directory Structure

Each version of tests is stored in a separate directory with the version number:

- `v1.0.0/` - First comprehensive test of agent simulations (September 2025)

## Versioning Approach

We follow semantic versioning for our test iterations:

- **MAJOR** version when we make incompatible changes to the test methodology
- **MINOR** version when we add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when we make backward compatible bug fixes or documentation updates

## Latest Test Results

The most recent test results can be found in the `v1.0.0` directory, which contains:

1. **Agent Test Results Summary** - Overview of the simulation results
2. **Test Coverage Summary** - Summary of the AuthService test coverage
3. **Test Implementation Documentation** - Detailed documentation for AuthService tests

## Test Methodology

In version 1.0.0, we used general-purpose agents to simulate our specialized agents rather than invoking the actual agent files directly. This approach allowed us to:

1. Verify that each agent's specialized focus could be maintained
2. Confirm that the agents could use their intended tools
3. Validate that the output format matched what each agent was designed to produce
4. Demonstrate that all agents could work effectively with the test project

## Future Testing

For future tests, we plan to:

1. Test actual agent invocation in the proper context
2. Expand testing to different programming languages and frameworks
3. Evaluate agent performance with larger codebases
4. Test cross-agent collaboration scenarios
5. Validate agent effectiveness with real-world projects
