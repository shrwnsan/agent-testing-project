# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Maintain and enhance a mock Node.js authentication service project designed for testing Qwen Code's subagents capabilities.

## Key Knowledge
- This is a mock authentication service using Node.js, Express.js, and bcrypt with in-memory storage
- Project includes endpoints for registration, login, user info retrieval, and search
- Contains intentional security vulnerabilities for agent testing evaluation
- Uses Jest for testing and follows standard Node.js conventions
- Project has two main branches: `main` and `clean`
- Agent definition files are stored in `.qwen/agents/` directory
- Automated testing workflow uses `scripts/agent-test.sh` to manage test environments

## Recent Actions
- Copied Qwen Code subagent definition files from `~/.qwen/agents` to the project's `.qwen/agents` directory
- Committed these agent files to both `main` and `clean` branches
- Updated the `scripts/agent-test.sh` script in both branches to use the latest clean branch commit hash (`c56b545c5d32230a3f553850390121dfc893513d`)
- Created proper commit messages explaining the changes for future reference

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Copy agent definition files to project directory
2. [DONE] Commit agent files to both main and clean branches
3. [DONE] Update agent-test.sh script with correct clean branch commit hash
4. [TODO] Continue with agent testing and evaluation as needed
